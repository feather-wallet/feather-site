# Ideas

In no particular order.

---

**FCMP++ Beta**

With FCMP++ testnet rapidly approaching, I'm aiming towards getting a FCMP++-ready beta release out, to give users the opportunity to play around on the testnet and report issues.

**Translations**

Write a glossary / style guide. Ready the codebase for translations. Hire a professional translator or set up a weblate for community translations.

**Practical Multisig UX**

Evaluate kayabaNerve's FROST-inspired multisig implementation as a more robust replacement for the wallet2 implementation.

Replace PyBitmessage as the message transport layer for the MMS with a new self-hostable message service, rethinking multisig wallet setup and abstracting away the MMS in wallets as much as possible.

**Integration testing**

Set up an extensive integration test suite for Feather that covers privacy & security guarantees and performance.

**Improve documentation**

Write accessible threat modeling documentation; mapping specific concerns to actions users can take.

**Monero Improvement Proposals**

Set up a BIP equivalent for Monero wallet standards.

**Better protection against memory attacks**

See: https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/issues/72#issuecomment-1405602142

**Add more settings that accomodate users with esoteric threat models**

Such as: lock wallet on session lock, prevent taking screenshots from app, "ephemeral mode".
