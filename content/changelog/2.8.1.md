- Windows: fixed a crash on startup if the path to the executable contains unicode characters.
- macOS: the minimum macOS version is now 12.
    - Qt silently dropped support for macOS 11 in Qt v6.8.0, which caused Feather 2.8.0 to crash on startup on macOS 11.
    - macOS 11 has been unsupported by Apple for over 18 months. Users are strongly advised to upgrade their operating system.
- Flatpak: should now be able to locate and use the host cursor theme.
    - If you still experience cursor issues after this release, make sure that `/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme` is not a symlink.

- Wizard: when trying to restore a 25-word seed, Feather should no longer incorrectly report that the checksum word is invalid.
- About: added a tab that shows version numbers of some components.
- Revuo: added a separator between the "Recent news" and "Upcoming events" section.
<br><br>
- Qt was updated to v6.9.0
- Tor was updated to v0.4.8.16
- OpenSSL was updated to v3.5.0
